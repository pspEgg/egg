## "Save Frame" macro

In Final Cut Pro X I get a film stripe I can scrub over to find a frame to export. This macro will:

1. Click at current mouse location. (to select the frame to export)
2. Select **Save Current Frame...** from menu.[^1]
3. Hit **Return** Twice. (navigate through dialogue boxes)
5. Down Arrow. (Load up the Next Clip)

{% highlight bash %}
mouse click #select frame to export
{% endhighlight %}
