# Clone & make<br>mistakes #

I DESTROYED my computer system by mistake[^1]; 
a clone steps in and takes its place. Knowing that
my "keyboard shortcuts" will stick around, and more importantly
that dangerous command line experiments are safe has
afforded me to build many powerful tools.

Most recent of those is a weird mix of automation tools that 
make it possible to color correct 100+ video clips 
in Lightroom. And as I refactor the tools for the command line, cloning has become all the more essential.

Cloning is dumb. it checks bit by bit to make sure two hard drive "clones" are identical. However back-up applications and Time Machine store data their own way. Your customization is much more at the mercy of the apps' restore algorithms, if it is backed up at all.

At the minimum cloning requires a free copy of [SuperDuper][superduper] and an external drive larger than your internal drive.
Connect the external to your computer and hit "copy" to turn your external into a clone. SuperDuper proves to be reliable by its
large following. For hard drive, I use [this 2TB portable drive][wd2tb].[^2]

[^1]: `rm -R ~`
[^2]: It's the largest external drive that doesn't require
    A/C power. SuperDuper clones are bootable albeit a bit slow.
