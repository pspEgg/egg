# Secret Menu

A LIST OF LINKS appears. The employee ID submitted via the web exists in the database. A link looks like this in HTML:

{% highlight html %}
<a href="/members">Manage Members</a>
{% endhighlight %}

The browser displays "Manage Members" in blue, and when the text is clicked, the browser will send a "GET" request to "/members". A *list* of links looks like this:

{% highlight html %}
<ul>
  <li><a href="/members">Manage Members</a></li>
  <li><a href="/reserve">Reserve Tee Time</a></li>
  <li><a href="/supply">Check Supply</a></li>
</ul>
{% endhighlight %}

The `<ul>` marks its innards as an *unordered* list. The `<li>` marks out *list items*. This way a screen reader can describe the chunk of text as a list to a blind person.

Let's set up our server to send the list:

{% highlight ruby %}
post '/' do
  erb :list if params[:employee_id] == '1'
end
{% endhighlight %}

Only employee ID "1" gets pass our server -- Upon the employee submitting the web form, our server checks if the sumbmitted ID is '1'. If ture, function `erb` reads "list.erb" for the HTML list.

Checking employee ID against a database of employee IDs requires we "connect" to the database first.

## Connecting to SQL Server

In terminal, execute `brew install freetds`. After a long installation process, execute `sudo gem install tiny_tds`.

Let's test the connection, in a new text file:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'tiny_tds'

db = TinyTds::Client.new(
  :username => 'team12', 
  :password => '6ro6giuh', 
  :host => '137.189.76.26', 
  :database => 'Team12')

db.execute("select e_id from employee")
{% endhighlight %}

The database connection is saved to `db`, from which SQL commands can be issued. To view the result of the command `select e_id from employee`:

{% highlight ruby %}
...

thing = db.execute("select e_id from employee")
array = thing.each
p array
{% endhighlight %}

The database connection gives us a "thing"; `.each` makes it into an array, which we can "print" with the `p` function. The terminal looks like this:

{% highlight bash %}
 > ruby database.rb
[{"e_id"=>3}, {"e_id"=>2}, {"e_id"=>1}]
{% endhighlight %}

The array of hashes represents the rows of the "e_id" column in the database.

## Check ID existence

The simplest way to check the ID submitted from the web form is to ask the database for that ID. *Unless* the database gives us an empty array, the ID exists; the list is sent.

{% highlight ruby %}
erb :list unless array.empty?
{% endhighlight %}

`select * from employee where e_id = 1` Asks for employee ID "1". To ask for the employee ID submitted from the web form:

{% highlight ruby %}
id = params[:employee_id]

sql = "select * from employee where e_id = #{id}"
{% endhighlight %}

`#{}` inserts variables into Strings. 

The final post function looks like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
post '/' do
  db = TinyTds::Client.new(
  :username => 'team12', 
  :password => '6ro6giuh', 
  :host => '137.189.76.26', 
  :database => 'Team12')

  id = params[:employee_id]
  sql = "select * from employee where e_id = #{id}"
  array = db.execute(sql).each

  erb :list unless array.empty?
end
{% endhighlight %}
