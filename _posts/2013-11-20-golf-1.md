# Employees Only

IN A WEB BROWSER the employee types in a URL and hits enter, causing the browser to send a "GET" request to the web server waiting at the URL. The web server returns some HTML:

{% highlight html %}
Enter ID: <input>
{% endhighlight %}

Let's build the server! In a text file, type:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'sinatra'
get '/' do
  "Enter ID: <input>"
end
{% endhighlight %}

That is all. Run it in the Terminal like this:

{% highlight bash %}
ruby [drag-text-file-into-terminal]
{% endhighlight %}

Go to URL `localhost:4567` to send our server a "GET" request. Our server sends us some HTML, and the browser displays the HTML as the text "Enter ID" along with a text box. The code `<input>` displays as a text box.

Let's look at our server code in detail.

## Sinatra makes life easier

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'sinatra'
get '/' do
  "Enter ID: <input>"
end
{% endhighlight %}

"Requiring" sinatra gives us a library of functions that simplifies development. The `get` function makes our web server respond to "GET" requests. The function takes 2 arguments:

1. The relative URL to respond to.
2. The code to execute upon request.

Sinatra is written in Ruby. Ruby is fun.
