# ID, Please.

A WEB FORM needs a submit button. The employee clicks the button to trigger a "POST" request to the server; data in the web form gets sent alongside the request. Here's a working web form:

{% highlight html %}
<form method="POST">
  Enter ID:
  <input name="employee_id">
  <input type="submit">
</form>
{% endhighlight %}

Unlike `"Enter ID: <input>"` this chunk of HTML will look tidier in its own file. However, for our server to find this file it needs to be in a folder named "view". For example:

    golf
      |- server.rb
      |- view
          |- form.erb

In addition, the file needs a **.erb** extension because we'll be using the `erb` function to find and process the file. Our new 'get' function looks like this now:

{% highlight ruby %}
get '/' do
  erb :form
end
{% endhighlight %}

Upon a "GET" request, the server executes code `erb :form` -- the 'erb' function reads the file 'form.erb' and passes the HTML to our server. 

To view the new web form, restart the server (stop the previous server by hitting `Ctrl C` in the terminal and run 'server.rb' again).

Our form has a new submit button. Clicking it will send a "POST" request with the `<form>`'s data to our server. The 'post' function handles "POST" request data:

{% highlight ruby %}
post '/' do
  params[:employee_id]
end
{% endhighlight %}

Our server reminds employees of their IDs.

## Key, value and hash

In our code, `params` is a hash. A hash stores data like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
{ key1 => value1, key2 => value, key3 => value3 }
{% endhighlight %}

`params[:employee_id]` gives us the value of the key ":employee_id". 

An array of hashes looks like a table in a database:

{% highlight ruby %}
[
{ :name => "Liz", :job => "Video Editor" },
{ :name => "Ria", :job => "Interior Decoration" },
{ :name => "Dan", :job => "Unemployeed"}
]
{% endhighlight %}
