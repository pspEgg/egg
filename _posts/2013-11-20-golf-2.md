# ID, Please.

A WEB FORM needs a submit button. The employee clicks the button to trigger a "POST" request to the server. Data from the web form gets sent alongside the request. Here's a working web form:

{% highlight html %}
<form action="/" method="POST">
  Enter ID:
  <input name="employee_id">
  <input type="submit">
</form>
{% endhighlight %}

Unlike `"Enter ID: <input>"` this chunk of HTML will look tidier in its own file. However, for our server to find the `<form>` file it needs to be in a folder named "view", for example:

    golf
      |- server.rb
      |- view
          |- form.erb

The file also needs a ".erb" extension. I'll explain later. Our new 'get' function looks like this now:

{% highlight ruby %}
get '/' do
  erb :form
end
{% endhighlight %}

Upon a "GET" request, the server executes code `erb :form` -- the 'erb' function reads the file 'form.erb' and produces our `<form>`. 

To view the new form, restart the server (stop the previous server by hitting `Ctrl C` in the terminal and run 'server.rb' again).

Our form has a new submit button. Clicking it will send a "POST" request, along with the `<form>`'s data to our server. Let's add a 'post' function to handle the data:

{% highlight ruby %}
post '/' do
  params[:employee_id]
end
{% endhighlight %}

The server now copycats.

## Key, value and hash

In our code, `params` is a hash. A hash stores data like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
{ key1 => value1, key2 => value, key3 => value3 }
{% endhighlight %}

`params[:employee_id]` gives us the value of the key ":employee_id". 

Incidentally, tha data SQL Server sends is stored in a hash.
